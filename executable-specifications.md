# Quotes of Executable Specifications with Scrum

## Chapter 3 - Discovering Through Short Feedback Loops and Stakeholders’ Desirements

- “Deliberate discovery does not happen from the failure itself but rather from understanding the failure, making an improvement, and then trying again.”
- “Frequent feedback loops provide you with the ability to correct errors while costs are minimal. It is the responsibility of the team not only to learn about the problem but also to help stakeholders understand what is being built for them.”
- “There is a powerful and important feedback loop that occurs when stakeholders have early access to running software. They can experiment with real software, come up with new ideas, and change their minds about old ideas and perceptions.”
- “Fulfilling desirements through early and continuous delivery of valuable software can result in sprints that stakeholders want to evaluate.”

## Chapter 4 - Expressing Desirements with User Stories

- “As a <role>, I want <desire> so that <benefit>.”
  - Who = role
  - What = desire
  - Why = benefit
- “A well-written user story follows the INVEST mnemonic developed by Bill Wake.”
  - **Independent**: A story should stand alone and be self-contained without depending on other stories.
  - **Negotiable**: A story is a placeholder that facilitates conversation and negotiation between the team and stakeholders. At any time, the story can be rewritten or even discarded. A story is not fixed and set in stone, up until it is part of the upcoming sprint.
  - **Valuable**: A story needs to deliver value to the stakeholders (either the end user or the purchaser).
  - **Estimable**: The team needs to be able to roughly estimate the size of the effort to complete the story.
  - **Small**: A story can start its life as a big placeholder. As time goes by and you better understand the intricacies of the desires, the place- holder will be split into smaller stories. When the most important ones are close to being delivered, they need to be small enough so that they can be completed in a single sprint.
  - **Testable**: A story must provide the necessary information to clearly define the acceptance criteria that confirm the story is completed.

## Chapter 5 - Refining User Stories by Grooming the Product Backlog

## Chapter 6 - Confirming User Stories with Scenarios
